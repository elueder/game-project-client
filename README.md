challenge/annoyance: removing outside border on board
- tried making div around it and making the border the background color
- set classes for each row and column and removed border that way

When adding X's and O's to arrays:
- 'turn' has already been returned, so X is played on even turns but has to be pushed to array on odd turns
- weird logic
